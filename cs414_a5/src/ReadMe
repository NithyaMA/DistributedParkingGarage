1. No external .jar dependancies. Did not use a database. Used program memory.Used swing user interface.For 
   logging, I typed exactly as per the github repository. For reference I have provided the github url.

2. I have included the starting of rmi registry in the program itself. So no need to start it seperately
   from command line. Start the cs414.a5.nithya.server.GarageServer.java. Then start the clients 
   cs414.a5.nithya.client.ParkingGarageStatusClient for knowing garage status
   cs414.a5.nithya.client.ParkingGarageEntry1 for entry 
   cs414.a5.nithya.client.ParkingGarageEntry2 for entry
   cs414.a5.nithya.client.ParkingGarageExit1 for exit
   cs414.a5.nithya.client.ParkingGarageExit2 for exit
   cs414.a5.nithya.client.ParkingGarageAdmin for admin functions
   
3. No user names and passwords are necessary

4. I have implemented the program as per the requirements of the assignment.

5. I have used refactorings like convert long methods to shorter methods, introduced methods to avoid comments, 
   Methods in improper classes were changed to the proper ones(Expert pattern), Avoided data clumps by introducing classes.
   I have used Facade pattern in my program.

Extra:
I have also retained the text based client (cs414.a5.nithya.client.GarageClient.java) in my application.
